                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>A hardcore patriotic, my aspiration in life is to enroll in the Indian Armed Forces with the aim of eventually getting inducted into the Para Special Forces. During this journey, I will carry with me important values that I was taught and cultivated in Sainik School Balachadi and as an NCC cadet, such as discipline, leadership, and resilience. I am curious by nature, love technology, and a quick learner. I am also looking forward to becoming a Software and Game Developer and contribute my part by solving problems using tech. They say two heads are better than one, and I think that philosophy rings true amongst combatants and coders alike; teamwork is paramount both on the battlefield and in the tech industry. Adaptability is also a necessary skill — being in mixed initiatives has made me learn and adopt a wide variety of styles, from development methodologies to coding languages — and as a soldier, you just have to keep on your toes. Both the military and the software field require constant self-betterment.</p>
